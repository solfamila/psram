## Test Results Summary

### Offline Analysis

- Demo: ✅ PASS
- Advanced Analysis: ✅ PASS
- Visualizations: ✅ PASS

## Key Findings

### Peripheral Access Patterns
- XSPI2: 306 accesses (50.9%) - Primary peripheral for PSRAM operations
- CLKCTL0: 147 accesses (24.5%) - Clock configuration and control
- IOPCTL2: 42 accesses (7.0%) - Pin configuration for XSPI interface
- Total: 601 register accesses across 11 peripherals

### Execution Phases
- Runtime: 403 accesses (67.1%) - Normal operation
- Board Init: 130 accesses (21.6%) - Hardware initialization
- Driver Init: 68 accesses (11.3%) - Driver setup

### Access Types
- Volatile Read: 285 accesses (47.4%)
- Volatile Write: 207 accesses (34.4%)
- Function Call Write: 109 accesses (18.1%)

### Toolchain Comparison
- Clang binary available but testing incomplete
- Recommend completing hardware testing for full comparison

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Review visualization dashboard for detailed analysis
2. Examine register access hotspots for optimization opportunities
3. Validate critical register configurations

### Future Work
1. Complete Clang toolchain build and testing
2. Perform extended hardware testing with real workloads
3. Implement register access optimization recommendations
4. Develop automated regression testing framework
