🎯 Why 0 Register Changes Were Detected:

1. **Initialization Timing**:
   - Peripheral initialization happens in first ~100ms after reset
   - Our monitoring started after firmware was already running
   - All critical register writes completed before monitoring began

2. **XSPI PSRAM Polling Nature**:
   - Polling transfer reads data without changing configuration registers
   - Once XSPI is configured, it operates through data buffers
   - No register modifications needed during normal operation

3. **Static Configuration**:
   - Most peripheral registers are "write-once" during initialization
   - Clock, pin mux, and peripheral enables remain static
   - Only data registers change during operation (not monitored)

🔧 Recommendations for Capturing Initialization:

1. **Reset-and-Monitor Approach**:
   - Reset target immediately before starting monitoring
   - Capture the first 5-10 seconds of execution
   - Use shorter polling intervals (10-50ms)

2. **Breakpoint-Based Monitoring**:
   - Set breakpoints at key initialization functions
   - Monitor registers during specific initialization phases
   - Use source-level debugging integration

3. **Targeted Register Monitoring**:
   - Focus on specific peripheral initialization sequences
   - Monitor only critical configuration registers
   - Use hardware watchpoints for real-time capture

4. **Multi-Phase Analysis**:
   - Phase 1: Board initialization (0-100ms)
   - Phase 2: Driver initialization (100ms-1s)
   - Phase 3: Application startup (1-5s)
